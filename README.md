# Unraveling the Debt Knot
- America's demand for repayment from France and Britain caused the two countries to press Germany for enormous reparations payments, totaling some $32 billion, as compensation for war-inflicted damages.  The Allies hoped to settle their debts with the United States with the money received from Germany.
- Disputes in government on whether or not war debts and reparations should have even been paid broke out.  Negotiated by Charles Dawes, the Dawes Plan Germany paid reparations to France and Britain, and the Allies paid war debts to the United States.  After the well of investors dried up in 1931, the jungle of international finance was turned into a desert.  President Herbert Hoover declared a one-year debt suspension in 1931.
- The United States never did get all its money from Britain, France The Soviet Union*  and Italy
 
# The Triumph of Herbert Hoover, 1928
- The Republicans chose Herbert Hoover.  Hoover was a small-town boy who worked his way through Stanford.  His experiences abroad strengthened his faith in American individualism, free enterprise, and small government.  Hoover had integrity, humanitarianism ( Food to Europe) ,
- The Democrats nominated Alfred E. Smith.  He was a Roman Catholic in an overwhelmingly Protestant country, and was "wet" at a time when the country was still in prohibition.
For the first time, the radio was used prominently in election campaigns.  Republican radio campaign.
The combination of Catholicism, wettism, foreignism, and liberalism of Smith was too much for the southerners KKK.  Herbert Hoover won the election of 1928 the first Republican candidate to have strong support in the SOUTH
 
# President Hoover's
- Two groups of citizens were POOR in the growing economy:  Non Union laborers and the disorganized farmers.
**The Agricultural Marketing Act**, passed in 1929, was designed to help the farmers.  It set up the Federal Farm Board, which could lend money to farm organizations seeking to buy, sell, and store agricultural surpluses.
In 1930, the Farm Board created the Grain Stabilization Corporation and the Cotton Stabilization Corporation.  Their goal was to boost falling prices by buying up surpluses.  The two agencies eventually failed.  Socialism. Guaranteed Prices
The Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930 started out as a mild tariff before 1,000 amendments were added to it.  It raised the tariff to 60%,high protective tariff, it increased international financial chaos.
 
# The Great Crash Ends the Golden Twenties A Symptom and a cause
- The catastrophic stock-market crash came in October 1929.  It was partially triggered by the British, who raised their interest rates in an effort to bring back capital lured abroad by American investments.  The British needed money; they were unable to trade with the United States due the high tariffs.
"Black Tuesday" occurred on October 29, 1929
 
# Hooked on the Horn of Plenty
- One of the main causes of the Great Depression was overproduction by both farm and factory.  The nation's ability to produce goods had outrun its capacity to consume or pay for them.  All the money was being invested in factories and other agencies of production; not enough money was going into salaries and wages.  Overexpansion of credit also contributed to the depression.
- The Great Depression continued the economic destruction of Europe, which had not yet fully recovered from WWI.
In the 1930s, a terrible drought scorched the Mississippi Valley, causing thousands of farms to be sold.
 
### Rugged Times for ***Rugged Individuals***
- In the beginning of the Great Depression, President Hoover believed that industry and self-reliance had made America great and that the government should play no role in the welfare of the people.  Rugged individualism He soon realized, however, that the welfare of the people in a nationwide catastrophe was a direct concern of the government.
- Hoover developed a plan in which the government would assist the railroads, banks, and rural credit corporations in the hope that if financial health was restored at the top of the economic pyramid, then unemployment would be relieved as the prosperity trickled down.  Hoover's efforts were criticized because he gave government money to the big bankers who had allegedly started the depression.
 
### Herbert Hoover Battles the Great Depression
- President Hoover secured from Congress $2.25 billion for useful public works.  (ex. the Hoover Dam)
Hoover was strongly opposed to all schemes that he saw as "socialistic."  He vetoed the Muscle Shoals Bill, which was designed to dam the Tennessee River and sell government-produced electricity in competition with citizens in private companies.
- In 1932, Congress established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was designed to provide indirect economic relief by assisting insurance companies, banks, agricultural organizations, railroads, and state and local governments.
- Congress passed the Norris-La Guardia Anti-Injunction Act in 1932, outlawing antiunion contracts and fording federal courts to issue injunctions to restrain strikes, boycotts, and peaceful picketing.
 
### The Bonus Army in Washington
- Veterans of WWI were among the hardest hit by the Great Depression.  A drive developed for the premature payment of the suspended bonus vetoed by Congress in 1924.
- The "Bonus Expeditionary Force" (BEF), which claimed over 20,000 people, converged on the capital in the summer of 1932, demanding the immediate payment of their entire bonus.
- After the BEF refused to leave the capital, President Hoover sent in the army to evacuate the group.  The ensuing riots and incidents brought additional public abuse of Hoover.
 
### Japanese Militarists Attack China
- In September 1931, Japanese imperialists, seeing that the Western world was bogged down in the Great Depression, invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria.  Although a direct violation of the League of Nations, the League was unable to do anything because it could not count on America's support.
- In 1932, Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson decided to only diplomatically attack the Japanese aggressors by issuing the Stimson doctrine.  It declared that the United States would not recognize any territorial acquisitions achieved by force.  Japan ignored the doctrine and moved onto Shanghaiin 1932.  The violence continued without the League of Nation's intervention as WWII was born.
